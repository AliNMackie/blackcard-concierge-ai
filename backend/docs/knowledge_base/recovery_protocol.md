**Tags**: recovery, hrv, sleep, cns

## Executive Summary
When HRV is low (<40ms) or subjective fatigue is high (8/10), immediate intervention is required to prevent overreaching.

## Intervention Tiers

### Tier 1: Immediate Steps (Red Status)
1.  **Hydration**: Consume 500ml water with 1g sodium immediately.
2.  **Breathwork**: perform "Physiological Sighs" for 5 minutes (double inhale, long exhale).
3.  **Light Exposure**: Get 10-20 minutes of sunlight, but avoid high intensity output.

### Tier 2: Sleep Optimization (Amber Status)
*   **Temperature**: Ensure room is 18°C (65°F).
*   **Magnesium**: 400mg Magnesium Bisglycinate 30min before bed.
*   **Theanine**: 200mg L-Theanine to reduce racing thoughts.

## Activity Modifications
*   **If RED**: Zone 1 only (Walking, Yoga). No heavy lifting.
*   **If AMBER**: Technical work allowed (50-60% intensity), but volume reduced by 50%.
*   **If GREEN**: Full send.
